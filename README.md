⭐ About Me 

Hi, I’m Faisal, a Full Stack Engineering student at Metana with a growing passion for building clean, functional, and user-focused web applications. I’m currently sharpening my skills in JavaScript, and expanding into modern full-stack technologies as I work through real-world projects and hands-on challenges.

With a strong curiosity for problem-solving and a willingness to learn fast, I enjoy breaking down complex ideas and turning them into simple, working solutions. My goal is to develop efficient, scalable applications while continuously improving as a developer.
I enjoy connecting with other developers and working on new ideas. If you’d like to collaborate, feel free to reach out on GitHub or email: karimfaisal1115@gmail.com.
